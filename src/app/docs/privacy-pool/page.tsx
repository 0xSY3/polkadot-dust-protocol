        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Stealth transfers give every payment a unique, unlinkable address. But once you <em>claim</em> those
          payments, all roads lead to your real wallet. An observer watching the claim address sees 10 inbound
          transactions from 10 different stealth addresses — and immediately knows those wallets belong to you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed">
          <strong className="text-white">DustPool V2</strong> solves this with a ZK-UTXO model on Polkadot Hub Testnet
          (chain 420420417). You deposit any amount of PAS into a shared pool. Each deposit creates a UTXO-style note
          with a Poseidon commitment. To withdraw, you generate a <strong>FFLONK proof</strong> (no trusted setup, but
          larger proving keys at ~223&ndash;283 MB cached via Cache API after first download) that proves you own valid
          notes without revealing which ones. The 2-in-2-out circuit consumes input notes and creates change notes,
          just like Bitcoin&apos;s UTXO model but with full privacy. The pool supports up to 2&sup2;&sup0; (~1,048,576)
          commitments.

          The anonymity set is the number of deposits in the Merkle tree at the time of withdrawal. A larger set

          correct guessing.

          Wait until the pool has accumulated a reasonable number of deposits before withdrawing. The dashboard

          <p>
            <strong className="text-white">Notes are encrypted in IndexedDB.</strong> V2 encrypts deposit notes with
            AES-256-GCM (key derived from your spending key). Even if someone accesses your browser storage,
            they cannot read note data without your stealth keys. Export and back up notes from the Settings page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong className="text-white">Compliance framework is present but disabled for testnet.</strong> The
            compliance verifier is set to address(0) on Polkadot Hub Testnet. A 1-hour cooldown after deposit still
            restricts withdrawals to the original depositor&apos;s address — giving compliance systems time to flag
            suspicious activity. The compliance oracle and verifier can be enabled for mainnet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong className="text-white">Denomination privacy via split withdrawals.</strong> Instead of fixed
            denominations, the split circuit breaks withdrawals into common amounts automatically. This prevents
            amount-based correlation while supporting arbitrary deposit sizes.
