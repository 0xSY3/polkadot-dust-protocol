        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Payment links are shareable URLs that let anyone send you a private stealth payment. When you register a
          <strong className="text-white"> .dust</strong> name, you automatically get a personal payment link at
          <code>/pay/yourname</code>. You can also create custom links with specific names, descriptions, and emoji icons
          for different purposes — like invoicing, tips, or donations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed">
          The receiver doesn&apos;t need to connect a wallet to create a link — only the sender needs a wallet to pay.
          Every payment goes to a fresh one-time stealth address derived via ECDH, so no on-chain link exists between
          the sender and the recipient&apos;s main address.

          The payment link URL contains no sensitive data — just the recipient&apos;s .dust name and an optional link slug.
          The stealth address is computed entirely client-side by the sender&apos;s browser using ECDH key agreement.
          The recipient claims incoming payments via their normal stealth scanner, which monitors ERC-5564 announcement events.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed">
          Because each payment generates a unique stealth address, an observer cannot link multiple payments to the same
          recipient — even if they all came through the same payment link. The link itself is just a convenient entry point;
          the privacy guarantees come from the underlying stealth address protocol.
