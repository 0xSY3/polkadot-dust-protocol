        <DepositAmountSnippet />
        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A deposit moves funds from your connected wallet into the shared <strong className="text-white">DustPoolV2</strong> contract.
          Instead of a simple balance transfer, the contract stores a cryptographic commitment — a Poseidon hash of your
          ownership key, the amount, asset type, chain ID, and a random blinding factor. This creates a UTXO-style note
          that only you can spend, using a ZK proof.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed">
          Deposits support <strong className="text-white">arbitrary amounts</strong> of PAS or USDC.
          There are no fixed denominations — you deposit exactly the amount you want. Two deposit modes are available:
          deposit from your connected wallet, or deposit from an external wallet via a generated
          deposit link or QR code. On Polkadot Hub Testnet (chain 420420417), the native currency is PAS.

          Before depositing, you must unlock your V2 keys by entering your 6-digit PIN. The PIN is combined with a wallet

          nullifier key. These keys are held in a React ref for the duration of your session — they are never persisted
          to storage. If you haven&apos;t set a PIN yet, the deposit modal will guide you through creating one.

          Compliance screening is <strong className="text-white">currently disabled</strong> on Polkadot Hub Testnet.
          The compliance verifier contract is not deployed, so deposits are accepted without sanctions checks.
          When enabled on mainnet, the deposit modal will screen wallet addresses against sanctions oracles before
          allowing deposits.

          The compliance cooldown system (restricting withdrawals to the original depositor address for 1 hour after
          deposit) is also inactive while the compliance verifier is not deployed. All deposits can be withdrawn
          or transferred immediately after Merkle tree inclusion.
